# MFSim
This is the previously-private repository for the UCR-APU Digital Microfluidic Biochip Simulator, developed primarily by Dr. Dan Grissom. This version is will most likely contain the most up-to-date code and should be more recent than the repository found at https://github.com/UCRMicrofluidics/MFSimStatic.
