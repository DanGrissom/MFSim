Hi Dan, 
I have This DAG that is failing to route, I have attached a self contained CFG file so you can run on your own. 

The Dag in question is an "empty" dag, technically is the branch head on a while loop. Effectively it passes the DAG from the entry to either the loop or the false branch. If possible can you help me out with this?


Routing Fail: DAG2:
Code: roy_maze_router.cc 205

Thanks,
Chris
