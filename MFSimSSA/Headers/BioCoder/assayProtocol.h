/*-------------------------------Class Details----------------------------------*
 * Type: BioCoder Class															*
 * Name: AssayProtocol (Assay Protocol)											*
 *																				*
 * Original source code from the following paper:								*
 * Authors: Vaishnavi Ananthanarayanan and William Thies						*
 * Title: Biocoder: A programming language for standardizing and automating		*
 * 			biology protocols													*
 * Publication Details: In J. Biological Engineering, Vol. 4, No. 13, Nov 2010	*
 * 																				*
 * Details: UCR has modified and added to the original biocoder so that it 		*
 * could actually be used for synthesis on a DMFB.								*
 * 																				*
 * This class represents an assay written in BioCoder and can be translated		*
 * to a DAG (usable by the DMFB simulator).										*
