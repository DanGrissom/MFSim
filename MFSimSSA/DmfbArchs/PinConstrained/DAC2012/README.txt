The files in this folder (DAC2012) represent pin-constrained designs detailed in:

Y. Luo and K. Chakrabarty. Design of pin-constrained general-purpose digital microfluidic biochips. DAC, 2012.

They only contain the DMFB dimensions and pin-mapping.  They can be input to the wire-router, but you might simply copy and paste the pin-mapping into another interface file for use.
