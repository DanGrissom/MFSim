The files in this folder (DAC2008) represent pin-constrained designs detailed in:

T. Xu and K. Chakrabarty. Broadcast electrode-addressing for pin-constrained multi-functional digital microfluidic biochips. DAC, 2008.

They only contain the DMFB dimensions and pin-mapping.  They can be input to the wire-router, but you might simply copy and paste the pin-mapping into another interface file for use.
