| KNOWN ISSUES |
- Number of wire-routing tracks in switching_aware_combined_wire_router_pin_mapper are hardcoded to 3
  b/c framework does not currently support setting those values before the Synthesis::WireRoute() 
  method is called (as standalone method); will work properly if run via Synthesis::EntireFlow(), but
  not via Synthesis::WireRoute(). 

| FIXED |
- Memory leaks in path_finder_wire_rotuer.cc and yeh_wire_router.cc (thanks Zach Zimmerman)

| KNOWN ISSUES |
- Nodes with 2+ dispense parents of the same type may cause the scheduler to crash if there are
  not enough free dispense ports (getReadyDispenseWell() returns NULL when it is expected to
  return a valid IoResource
  - Basically, the first check for getReadyDispenseWell() doesn't expect a node to have two
    parents of the same dispensing fluid type
  - TEMPORARY WORKAROUND => Try adding 1+ additional ports of the duplicate fluid OR change the
    fluid type of the duplicate fluid types so they are different; this will obviously change the
    assay, but may be a suitable workaround in some cases
- compactRoutesWithMidStalls() doesn't seem to work properly as it always defaults to compactRoutesWithBegStalls()

| FIXED |
- Putting spaces in the Assay file's DAGNAME attribute will no longer cause output problems for dotty
