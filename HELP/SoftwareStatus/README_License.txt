Academic Non-Commercial License

Academic users (e.g., educational institutions, U.S. government research labs, and non-profit research institutes) may use the UCR Digital Microfluidic Static Synthesis Simulator (UCR DMFBSSS), as well as modify and add to its source code free-of-charge for non-commercial research and instruction.  Support is not provided except as our time happens to permit.

Any use of the UCR DMFBSSS software, in binary or source form, in a commercial setting or application (e.g., use within a for-profit business, use to generate intellectual property for patents, or use to implement a consulting contract) for any reason, purpose or goal is considered commercial use of the UCR DMFBSSS software and thus requires explicit permission and licensing from the original authors.  Please contact microfluidics@cs.ucr.edu if you would like to receive more information about using the UCR DMFBSSS commercially.

We encourage the academic users above to use, add to and improve upon the UCR DMFBSSS and hope that it will be a valuable learning and research tool for the digital microfluidics research community.
