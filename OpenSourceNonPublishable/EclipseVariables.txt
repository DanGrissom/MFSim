1) Just download latest MinGW-w64 from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
	- Click Files->Toolchains targetting Win64->PersonalBuilds->mingw-builds->5.1.0 (or latest)->threads-posix->seh
	- Download the 7z file and extract contents to "C:\MinGW64"

2) When creating new project, make sure to uncheck "Display compatible toolchains only"

Look in C/C++ Environment and make sure are (should be auto unless had older version of MinGW):
MINGW_HOME is: C:\MinGW64
PATH contains: ${MINGW_HOME}\bin;

BE CAREFUL, if value is set in Windows Environmental Variables, it might override to previous MinGW version or wrong folder

MSYS_HOME NOT NEEDED: (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0)
